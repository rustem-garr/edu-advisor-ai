### CS572 Final Project - June 2025 - Application specifications and requirements
You are responsible for defining your project's specifications and requirements. Take time to plan your project idea, write a brief description, set clear goals, and establish a well-defined scope. Your project must meet the following requirements:
* Implement a login-based system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, with support for access and refresh tokens.
* Integrate AI features into the application, such as function calling, agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
* Protect all frontend add/update/delete actions and routes from public access using JWT, except for sign-up and sign-in routes.
* Secure all backend add/update/delete routes from public access using JWT, except for sign-up and sign-in routes.
* Apply lazy loading to frontend routes and adhere to standard REST design principles for the backend.
* Ensure both frontend and backend code are strictly typed, avoiding the use of explicit or implicit `any` types.
* Use the latest Angular API (v20) specifications for frontend development, avoiding deprecated practices.
* Manage application global and local state using `signal`.
* Develop a user interface that adheres to web standards, utilizing Angular Material or a comparable UI kit.
  
Note: Chat and product listing applications are not allowed.  
  
### Notes and Policies
* **Project Initiation:** On the first day, prepare a detailed project description, UI screen sketches, and a MongoDB schema design. Contact me on Teams to review and approve the database design and project scope before starting to code.
* **Classroom Attendance:** Physical attendance in the classroom is not required during the project.
* **Instructor Availability:** I am available for support via Teams during regular class hours (10:00 AM–12:30 PM and 2:00 PM–3:00 PM, Monday through Saturday). No support is available on Sundays.
* **Student Availability:** You must be reachable via Teams during class hours for periodic check-ins. Failure to respond to Teams calls or messages within 15 minutes may impact your final grade.
* **Code Submission:** Submit a daily code push by the end of each day to demonstrate progress. Each push must include commits organized by feature. Missing pushes or inadequate commits may affect your final grade.
      
### Technical Evaluation
Please submit your final project push by 9:00 PM on Tuesday. Prepare a screen-recorded demo that introduces the project concept and demonstrates system usage. Share the video URL via Teams. Do not include or discuss code patterns, as code evaluations will be conducted separately. I will call you on Teams as per the following schedule:  
  
**Wednesday:**  
* Ali 10:00 AM
* Anas 10:30 AM
* Chanchhunneng 11:00 AM

### Code Honor Submission Policy
All submitted code must be original. Submitting code from another source as your own, including copied patterns or snippets, constitutes plagiarism and will impact your grade. Using AI code assistance tools or generative AI for coding is prohibited for this project. Failure to explain your code during the technical evaluation will result in a No Credit (NC) grade and an academic misconduct warning for plagiarism. The only permitted AI use is for writing prompts or integrating AI APIs to add smart features to your application. Refer to the syllabus for complete course policies.
